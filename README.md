This is useful to anyonme who needs to summarize a text of whatever length into a coherent summary.  
What is important to keep in mind is that the corpus must be in a txt format and located on the user's Google Drive so that it will be retrieved easily.

Step 2  Trim non-essentials from text ( Publisher info or legal disclaimers, etc.)

Step 4  Upload text to your Google Drive
Step 5  Start Google Colab.
Step 6   Follow the steps in the lab, making sure to change the text name to the name of your text and the path to the path of your text.  This is extremely important, so be careful about spelling, capitalization, spacing, etc.)
You should have no issues if following the steps.
