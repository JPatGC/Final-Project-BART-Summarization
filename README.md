# Final-Project-BART-Summarization
This lab allows one to take a corpus of text and to summarize it.  The lab here presented was trained on a novel and on a collection of 5 novels combined.
This is useful to anyonme who needs to summarize a text of whatever length into a coherent summary.  
What is important to keep in mind is that the corpus must be in a txt format and located on the user's Google Drive so that it will be retrieved easily.
